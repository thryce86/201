# Class 02 

## Ch2 
- Semantic markup: Seems to mean extra info like quotes.  Structural seems to be more imp.  Its the headings and footers etc
- `<b>` to do bold place it inside the actual sentence. 
- `<br>` to actually space out things within the paragraph itself 
- `<hr />` makes a horizontal line.
- There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages — they are known as semantic markup.
- use blockqoute with a paragraph to have the quotation below it 

## Ch 10
- The closer you are to the actual code the higher the order of precedence.  Inline will overwrite external and internal.
- Think of the body as simply a big box you will fit other boxes into.
- CSS just defines the format of Html elements.  Thats it. 
- property : value 
- Declare css with `<link>` in the head to use CSS externally
- When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet
- `<p style=“color:red;”>`
- CSS selectors will be a problem.
- !important  allows you to make that particular styling more imp?
- inherited -  they are talking about defining element like classes and then inheriting that attribute to the other child elements 
- external CSS is good because it allows your site to load faster.  You are not rerunning the code all the time :)


## Chap 2 JS 
- JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE
- /* characters and ending with the */ to do multi-line comments. 
- var colors;
colors = [‘white’,
          ‘black’,
          ‘custom’];  to get an array
- colors.length;  to call sth from an array 
- expression just means it returns a single value 


## Chap 4 JS 
- Condition the evaluated arguement 
- &&  is how you do and in js.
- !() to do not
- function name (args){}
- dont use else()  no need in js
