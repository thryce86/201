ch 15  Layouts
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors
- relative keeps others in place 
- absolute - its relative to the parent .  they move with the parent 
- fixed is in relation to the browser while floating the text wraps around the floating element 
- relative means in relation to the normal flow 
- Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10 will appear over the top of one with a z-index of 5.
- float allows you to have text wrapping
