Basic point of the entire article is topay attention to unspoken norms.
I honestly really dont put too much faith in any of this because as a statistics student 
I have alwayyyys found "psychology research" to be hillarious.   Case in point these wonderful researchers 
were able to define "intelligence parameters"  ohh really now?  How exactly do you define intelligence?
Is it mathematical skills?  I literally just did homework with data from the california school system that 
out of a group of covariates the #1 correlation for mathematical skills is not test scores but rather 
their parents income level. IE poor people do not get exposure to math.  Does this make them less intelligent? 
Of course this article doesn't actuallyy concretely define what they are suppose to be measuring just that they found sth.
Little dirty secret of statistics if you dont have definite definitions before you carryout an experiment you can always 
find something.  The psychological safety part seems nice and basically boils down to be nice follow norms and find what works.
But ughh pretty shoddy reporting that really devalues the conclusions they are trying to support
