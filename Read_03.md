-`</a>` to do links givs you a link for the text you want
- can link within page using ID 
- absolute URL. full site address
- URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
- On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
- root - highest folder.  Parent of everything. 
- Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.  So its not just when accessing outside content. 
 - subs  current / sub.html       movies/dvd/reviews.html

- There are sublinks. mailto:  Open email link. 
- target.  This will open up a new page so the user stays on your site ;)
- Therefore, the href attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the website that accompanies this book, you would write:` <a href=“http:/www.htmlandcssbookcom/#bottom”>`

ch 15  Layouts
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors
- relative keeps others in place 
- absolute - its relative to the parent .  they move with the parent 
- fixed is in relation to the browser while floating the text wraps around the floating element 
- relative means in relation to the normal flow 
- Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10 will appear over the top of one with a z-index of 5.
- float allows you to have text wrapping
