-`</a>` to do links givs you a link for the text you want
- can link within page using ID 
- absolute URL. full site address
- URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
- On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.
- root - highest folder.  Parent of everything. 
- Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.  So its not just when accessing outside content. 
 - subs  current / sub.html       movies/dvd/reviews.html

- There are sublinks. mailto:  Open email link. 
- target.  This will open up a new page so the user stays on your site ;)
- Therefore, the href attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the website that accompanies this book, you would write:` <a href=“http:/www.htmlandcssbookcom/#bottom”>`
