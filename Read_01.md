Ask about:
1. whats up with your site not showing
2. how do i reference these tags without it actually performing some of these actions?

# Main points I didn't know 



- 
- Tags are often referred to as elements.  Thought they were different things like elements , id ,etc.
- Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on
- Html doesnt care about space so if you have a lot in a text it will simply format it as single space. it's white space collapsing.
- To make a space use <br />
- <abbr> allows you to have a glide over link  so if you hover over it you will see the full attribute. 
- <ins> <del>  these tags show how to strike thru and underline 
-  We need to add DOCTYPES because there were so many different standards back in the day.  You cant put even a spce before this 
- id acts like a object name.  so you can have lots of similiar instances but affect one by calling its ID.
- name them Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). 
          It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
- ********* Class is simply the same as OOP class.  You can affect all headers at once for example. But its not a primitive you could declare a SET OF HEADERS with class and affect it that way 
- *************** Classs can be given to multiple element types.  So if you want the same style on headers and links you can do that. " class1 class2" to define multiple.
- Element is any type so header is not an element  but rather any html tag 
- block elements <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.
- inline "<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>".
- <span> is confusing but seems to be a way for us to use CSS?
- iframes are what you use to add access to other apps like maps or a stock ticker
- <meta>  this defines how search engines will treat the page
- You dont actually have to give the location of a block inside the page.  Just use id= for that block element 
- Html 5 added <article> and <aside> to deal with content in the middle of the page so you can do more side to side work
- Search engines seem to put more emphasis on the <article> region so if you have important content make sure to add it there   
- Try not to use <div> but rather use the correctly designed tags. Still be careful if you need to do sth then don't just adhoc one of those tags in use the <div>.
- Target the site. Think in terms of outcomes for the user. 
- Make a site map and use card sorting. Site map is just a web diagram.
- Wireframe is just a mock up of a page.
